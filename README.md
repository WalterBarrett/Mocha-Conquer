# Mocha Conquer

Mocha Conquer is a mod for Vanilla Conquer aimed at adding new features to the first generation C&C engine.

## Releases

Binary releases of the latest commit are available from [here](https://github.com/WalterBarrett/Mocha-Conquer/releases/tag/latest), which is updated whenever new code is merged into the main branch.

## Building

See [Vanilla Conquer's build instructions](https://github.com/TheAssemblyArmada/Vanilla-Conquer?tab=readme-ov-file#building). Despite the rebranding, the `VANILLATD` and `VANILLARA` constants are still used. The rebranding is only to prevent people from bothering The Assembly Armada over Mocha Conquer and to allow running Vanilla Conquer and Mocha Conquer side-by-side.

## Running

See [Vanilla Conquer's running instructions](https://github.com/TheAssemblyArmada/Vanilla-Conquer?tab=readme-ov-file#running).
